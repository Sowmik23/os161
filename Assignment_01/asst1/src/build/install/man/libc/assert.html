<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
assert - check assumptions at run time
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>assert(expression);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>assert</tt> checks that its argument evaluates to true. If this is not the
case, an error message is printed and <A HREF=abort.html>abort</A> is
called.
</p>

<p>
<tt>assert</tt> is a macro. If the macro <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined at
compile time, assertion tests are removed.
</p>

<h3>Caution</h3>
<p>
Avoid writing assert expressions with side effects, as compiling with
<tt>NDEBUG</tt> normally causes the side effects to disappear.
