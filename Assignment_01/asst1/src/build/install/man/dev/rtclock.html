<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
rtclock - realtime clock
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
device rtclock0 at ltimer*
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The rtclock device is the generalized interface to the time of day. It
provides the in-kernel function gettime().

<p>
Only the first clock attached is used. If no clock at all is found,
the system will panic if gettime() is called.
