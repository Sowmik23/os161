<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
con - system login console
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
device con0 at lser*<br>
device con0 at lscreen*<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The generic console device can be attached to either a serial port or
a memory-mapped screen. It provides a small input buffer but no input
editing. You may add such features if you desire.
</p>

<p>
The in-kernel kprintf() routine and its relatives send their
output to the console device.
