<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
random - kernel randomness source
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
device random0 at lrandom*<br>
device random0 at pseudorand0<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The random device is the generalized interface to randomness sources.
Only one random device is used; if more are attached they are ignored.
If no random device is found, the kernel may not run.
</p>

<p>
The random device provides both the in-kernel random() function and a
VFS-level character device, called <tt>random:</tt>. Bytes read from the
latter have random values; writes are discarded.
