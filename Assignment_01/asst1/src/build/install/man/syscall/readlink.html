<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
readlink - fetch symbolic link contents
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>readlink(const char *</tt><em>path</em><tt>, char *</tt><em>buf</em><tt>,
size_t </tt><em>len</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>readlink</tt> retrieves the contents of the symbolic link named by
<em>path</em> and places them in the buffer <em>buf</em>. At most
<em>len</em> bytes are written.
</p>

<p>
<tt>readlink</tt> does not include a null terminator in <em>buf</em>.
</p>

<p>
The call (like all system calls) should be atomic.
Note that the kernel is not obliged to (and generally cannot) make the
read atomic with respect to other threads in the same process
accessing the buffer during the operation.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
<tt>readlink</tt> returns the number of characters transferred. If an
error occurs, -1 is returned, and <A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set
according to the error encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
