<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
ctest - cyclic stride-oriented VM test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/ctest</tt> [<em>stride</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>ctest</tt> creates a 1-megabyte array of pointers and sets it up
as a circular linked list, then traverses the linked list. The linked
list is set up so each entry points to the one <em>stride</em> entries
away.
</p>

<p>
The <em>stride</em> argument should be odd, so all elements in the
list are accessed.
</p>

<p>
The default stride is 477.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>ctest</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>ctest</tt> should function properly once the VM assignment is
complete.
</p>
