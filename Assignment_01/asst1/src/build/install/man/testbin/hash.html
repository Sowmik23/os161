<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
hash - compute a simple hash function of a file
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/hash</tt> <em>file</em><br>
<tt>host-hash</tt> <em>file</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>hash</tt> takes a file and computes a hash value for it by adding
all the bytes in the file together modulo a prime.
</p>

<p>
<tt>hash</tt> is by default also compiled for the System/161 host OS
so you can cross-check the answers you get.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>hash</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Once the basic system calls are complete, hash should work on any file
the system supports. However, it will probably of most use for testing
while working on the file system.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
<tt>hash</tt> uses a silly hash algorithm.
