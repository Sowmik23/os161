<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
guzzle - waste cpu
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/guzzle</tt> [<em>character</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>guzzle</tt> burns cpu and periodically prints a character. The
default character is a plus sign (+). It differs from
<A HREF=hog.html>hog</A> chiefly in the printing and in that it runs
longer.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>guzzle</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is only likely to be useful for testing the scheduler.
