<h2 align=center>tail</h2>
<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
tail - print part of a file
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/tail</tt> <em>file</em> <em>location</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>tail</tt> prints the contents of a file starting at offset
<em>location</em> within it, skipping the beginning.
</p>

<p>
It is somewhat similar in concept to the Unix tail command, but is not
compatible, which is why it lives in testbin.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>tail</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>tail</tt> should work once the basic system calls are complete,
but will probably be most useful as a debugging tool while working on
the file system.
