These are support functions needed by gcc to perform operations on
64-bit integer types on 32-bit machines. The names are meaningful to
the gcc back end. The term "millicode" is sometimes used to describe
such compiler support code.

This code was taken from NetBSD's src/common/lib/libc/quad, and
polished some for OS/161.
