# This file was generated by configure. Edits will disappear if you rerun

# work, let the course staff know and we'll try to fix the configure script.
#
# The purpose of this file is to hold all the makefile definitions
# needed to adjust the OS/161 build process to any particular
# environment. If I've done it right, all you need to do is rerun the
# configure script and make clean if you start working on a different
# host OS. If I've done it mostly right, you may need to edit this
# file but you still hopefully won't need to edit any of the
# makefiles.
#
# The things that can be set here are documented in mk/os161.config.mk.
