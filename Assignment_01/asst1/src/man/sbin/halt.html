<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
halt - halt system
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/sbin/halt</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>halt</tt> shuts the system down. A clean shutdown is performed,
flushing buffers to disk, unmounting filesystems, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Once shutdown is complete, <tt>halt</tt> stops execution of the
operating system. What this entails depends on the platform. On
platforms with a hardware boot monitor, it normally returns to the
boot monitor. On software-based platforms, such as System/161, it
normally terminates the software simulation. On other platforms the
system will generally wait for a keystroke on the console and then
reboot.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>halt</tt> uses the <A HREF=../syscall/reboot.html>reboot</A>
system call.
</p>

<p>
<tt>halt</tt> will function properly even before you do any work on
OS/161.
