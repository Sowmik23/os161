<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
sbrktest - program for testing <A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A>
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/sbrktest</tt> [<em>test-number ...</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>sbrktest</tt> contains a number of tests for memory allocation,
using the <A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A> low-level interface
directly instead of via <A HREF=../libc/malloc.htmlm>malloc</A>.
It is similar to <A HREF=malloctest.html>malloctest</A> in general
layout and approach, but concentrates on kernel-level memory
allocation rather than the behavior of C malloc.
</p>

<p>
There are 21 tests:
<table>
<tr><td width=5% valign=top>1</td><td>Allocate one page.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>2</td><td>Allocate and free one page.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>3</td><td>Allocate and free several pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>4</td><td>Allocate several pages and free them one
				at a time.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>5</td><td>Check the heap end.
				This test crashes intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>6</td><td>Allocate and check the heap end.
				This test crashes intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>7</td><td>Allocate and free and check the heap end.
				This test crashes intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>8</td><td>Allocate several, free some, then check
				the heap end.
				This test crashes intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>9</td><td>Allocate all memory in a big chunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>10</td><td>Allocate all memory one page at a time.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>11</td><td>Allocate a lot and intentionally leak
				it.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>12</td><td>Fork and then allocate.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>13</td><td>Allocate and then fork.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>14</td><td>Allocate and then fork and free.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>15</td><td>Allocate, fork, allocate more, and
				free.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>16</td><td>Small stress test.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>17</td><td>Randomized small stress test.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>18</td><td>Small stress test with specific seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>19</td><td>Large stress test.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>20</td><td>Randomized large stress test.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>21</td><td>Large stress test with specific seed.</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
One or more tests may be run specifically by giving the numbers on the
command line; otherwise, <tt>sbrktest</tt> prints the list and prompts
for a test number to run.
</p>

<p>
Note that the tests that crash intentionally should crash the
<tt>sbrktest</tt> program with an illegal memory access
(<tt>SIGSEGV</tt>) -- they should not crash your kernel.
</p>

<p>
The tests that attempt to allocate all available memory may be slow,
depending on the per-process limits you place on memory allocation (if
any) relative to the amount of available physical RAM.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>sbrktest</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>sbrktest</tt> should work properly once you have implemented the
sbrk system call and a virtual memory system that supports dynamic
memory allocation.
It will not work with dumbvm.
