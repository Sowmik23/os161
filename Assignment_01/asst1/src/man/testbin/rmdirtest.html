<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
rmdirtest - test removing in-use directories
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/rmdirtest</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>rmdirtest</tt> creates a test directory, goes into it, removes it,
and attempts to do various operations on it. It tries to check that
the right things happen, although some cases are beyond its ability to
test directly (such as whether storage is leaked).
</p>

<p>
Note that while it is not legal to remove the <tt>.</tt>
<em>entry</em> in a directory, it is perfectly legal to remove a
directory by name that happens to be some process's (or your own)
current working directory.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
rmdirtest uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/chdir.html>chdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/__getcwd.html>__getcwd</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/getdirentry.html>getdirentry</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/mkdir.html>mkdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rmdir.html>rmdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>rmdirtest</tt> should run correctly once the file system
assignment is complete.
