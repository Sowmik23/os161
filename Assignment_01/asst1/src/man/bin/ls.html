<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
ls - list files or directory contents
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/ls</tt> [<tt>-adlRs</tt>] [<em>path</em>...]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>ls</tt> lists the filesystem objects specified on the command
line. If they are directories, the contents of the directories are
listed (unless the <tt>-d</tt> option is used).
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>-a</tt> option is given, filenames beginning with dot (.)
will be listed. Ordinarily, they are skipped.
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>-d</tt> option is given, directory contents will not be
listed; the directories themselves will be.
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>-l</tt> option is given, a long format listing showing the
file size, type, and link count will be displayed instead of just the
filenames.
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>-R</tt> option is given, subdirectories encountered will be
listed recursively.
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>-s</tt> option is given, the number of filesystem blocks
used by each object will be displayed in addition to other
information.
</p>

<p>
If no <em>paths</em> are specified, the current directory is assumed.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>ls</tt> uses the following syscalls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fstat.html>fstat</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/getdirentry.html>getdirentry</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As fstat and getdirentry are generally not part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>ls</tt> will usually still not function after
the basic system calls assignment is complete.
These calls are typically part of a later assignment, usually the file
system assignment. You may also need to implement the getdirentry
functionality at the file system level.
Consult your course materials for specific information.
