<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
sync - synchronize buffers to disk
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/sync</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>sync</tt> causes filesystem I/O buffers that have been modified
but not yet written to be written to disk.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>sync</tt> uses the <A HREF=../syscall/sync.html>sync</A> system
call, and of course <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>sync</tt> should function once the sync system call is wired up.
This is likely part of the file system assignment
</p>
