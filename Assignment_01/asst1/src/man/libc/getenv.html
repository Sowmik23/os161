<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
getenv - retrieve an environment variable
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>char *</tt><br>
<tt>getenv(const char *</tt><em>variable</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>getenv</tt> retrieves the value of the environment variable
<em>variable</em> from the current process environment.
Unless you implement <tt>execve</tt> and environment variable passing,
the environment used is a default environment compiled into libc.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>getenv</tt> returns a pointer to the value of the
requested variable.
This pointer points to internal storage and the contents should not be
modified.
The contents will in turn be stable until/unless the process
environment is modified.
If the requested variable is not found, <tt>getenv</tt> returns
<tt>NULL</tt>.
