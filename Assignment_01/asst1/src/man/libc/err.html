<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The <tt>err</tt>, <tt>errx</tt>, <tt>verr</tt>, and <tt>verrx</tt>
functions print error messages to the standard error stream.
</p>

<p>
<tt>errx</tt> prints the name of the program, a colon, the text
generated by passing <em>format</em> and subsequent args through
<A HREF=printf.html>printf</A>, and a newline. Then,
<A HREF=exit.html>exit</A> is called and passed the supplied
<em>exitcode</em>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>err</tt> does the same thing, except that a colon and the error
string for the current error (obtained by calling
<A HREF=strerror.html>strerror</A> on
<A HREF=../syscall/errno.html>errno</A>) are printed prior to the
newline.
</p>

<p>
<tt>verrx</tt> and <tt>verr</tt> are the same as errx and err
respectively, except that the additional arguments for printf are
taken to have been already packaged up in a <tt>va_list</tt> by use of
the <A HREF=stdarg.html>stdarg</A> facility.
