<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
bzero - zero out memory
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>void</tt><br>
<tt>bzero(void *</tt><em>buf</em><tt>, size_t </tt><em>len</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The region of memory pointed to by <em>buf</em>, of length
<em>len</em>, is zeroed out.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
Zeroing the bytes of a floating point number does not necessarily
produce a floating point zero value.
Similarly, zeroing the bytes of a pointer does not necessarily produce
<tt>NULL</tt>.
