<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
__time - get time of day
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;time.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>__time(time_t *</tt><em>seconds</em><tt>,
uint32_t *</tt><em>nanoseconds</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The current time (in seconds and nanoseconds since midnight GMT on
January 1, 1970) is retrieved. If <em>seconds</em> and/or
<em>nanoseconds</em> are non-null, the corresponding components of the
time are stored through those pointers.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
__time returns 0 on success. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set to indicate the error.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error is the only way __time should be capable of failing.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=1>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>EFAULT</td>
			<td><em>seconds</em> or <em>nanoseconds</em>
			was an invalid non-NULL address.</td></tr>
</table>
