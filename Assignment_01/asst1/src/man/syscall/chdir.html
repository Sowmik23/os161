<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
chdir - change current directory
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>chdir(const char *</tt><em>pathname</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The current directory of the current process is set to the directory
named by <em>pathname</em>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>chdir</tt> (like all system calls) should be atomic.
Note that the kernel is not obliged to (and generally cannot) make the
chdir call atomic with respect to other threads in the same
process accessing the pathname string during the operation.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, chdir returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other errors not
mentioned here.
<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=6>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10%>ENODEV</td>
			<td>The device prefix of <em>pathname</em> did
				not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ENOTDIR</td>	<td>A non-final component of <em>pathname</em>
				was not a directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ENOTDIR</td>	<td><em>pathname</em> did not refer to a
				directory.</td>
<tr><td>ENOENT</td>	<td><em>pathname</em> did not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>EIO</td>	<td>A hard I/O error occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>EFAULT</td>	<td><em>pathname</em> was an invalid pointer.</td></tr>
