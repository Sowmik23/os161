<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
lseek - change current position in file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>off_t</tt><br>
<tt>lseek(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>, off_t </tt><em>pos</em><tt>,
int </tt><em>whence</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>lseek</tt> alters the current seek position of the file handle
<em>filehandle</em>, seeking to a new position based on <em>pos</em>
and <em>whence</em>.
</p>

<p>
If <em>whence</em> is
<ul>
<li> SEEK_SET, the new position is <em>pos</em>.
<li> SEEK_CUR, the new position is the current position plus <em>pos</em>.
<li> SEEK_END, the new position is the position of end-of-file
	plus <em>pos</em>.
<li> anything else, lseek fails.
</ul>
Note that <em>pos</em> is a signed quantity.
</p>

<p>
It is not meaningful to seek on certain objects, such as the console
device. All seeks on these objects fail.
</p>

<p>
Seek positions less than zero are invalid. Seek positions beyond EOF
are legal, at least on regular files.
</p>

<p>
As discussed under <A HREF=getdirentry.html>getdirentry</A>, seek
positions on directories are defined by the file system and should not
be interpreted.
</p>

<p>
Note that each distinct open of a file should have an independent seek
pointer.
</p>

<p>
<tt>lseek</tt> (like all system calls) should be atomic. In this case
this means that multiple threads or processes sharing the same seek
pointer should be able to update it without seeing or generating
invalid intermediate states. There is no provision for making pairs of
<tt>lseek</tt> and <tt>read</tt> or <tt>write</tt> calls atomic.  The
<tt>pread</tt> and <tt>pwrite</tt> calls in Unix were invented to
address this issue. (These are not in OS/161 by default but are easy
to implement.)
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>lseek</tt> returns the new position. On error, -1 is
returned, and <A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the
error encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=4>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>EBADF</td>
				<td><em>fd</em> is not a valid file
				handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ESPIPE</td>	<td><em>fd</em> refers to an object
				which does not support seeking.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EINVAL</td>	<td><em>whence</em> is invalid.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EINVAL</td>	<td>The resulting seek position would
				be negative.</td></tr>
</table>
