<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
open - open a file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>open(const char *</tt><em>filename</em><tt>,
int </tt><em>flags</em><tt>);</tt><br>

</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>open</tt> opens the file, device, or other kernel object named by
the pathname <em>filename</em>. The <em>flags</em> argument specifies
how to open the file. The optional <em>mode</em> argument provides the
file permissions to use and is only meaningful in Unix, or if you
choose to implement Unix-style security later on. it can be ignored in
OS/161.
</p>

<p>
The flags argument should consist of one of
<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=30%>O_RDONLY</td>	<td>Open for reading only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O_WRONLY</td>		<td>Open for writing only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O_RDWR</td>		<td>Open for reading and writing.</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
It may also have any of the following flags OR'd in:
<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=4>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=20%>O_CREAT</td>
			<td>Create the file if it doesn't exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O_EXCL</td>	<td>Fail if the file already exists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O_TRUNC</td>	<td>Truncate the file to length 0 upon open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O_APPEND</td>	<td>Open the file in append mode.</td></tr>
</table>
O_EXCL is only meaningful if O_CREAT is also used.
</p>

<p>
O_APPEND causes all writes to the file to occur at the end of file, no
matter what gets written to the file by whoever else, including
concurrently. (This functionality may be optional; consult your
course's assignments.)
</p>

<p>
<tt>open</tt> returns a file handle suitable for passing to
<A HREF=read.html>read</A>,
<A HREF=write.html>write</A>,
<A HREF=close.html>close</A>,
etc. This file handle must be greater than or equal to zero.  Note
that file handles 0 (STDIN_FILENO), 1 (STDOUT_FILENO), and 2
(STDERR_FILENO) are used in special ways and are typically assumed by
user-level code to always be open.
</p>

<p>
If you are implementing symbolic links, there are some additional
points to take note of. If <em>filename</em> refers to a symbolic
link, that link does not point to an existing object, and O_CREAT is
specified, a new file is created <i>at the name the link points
to</i>. However, if in this case both O_CREAT and O_EXCL are
specified, <tt>open</tt> fails with EEXIST. These semantics are a
nuisance to implement but important for correct functioning.
</p>

<p>
<tt>open</tt> (like all system calls) should be atomic. It is
important for the handling of O_EXCL in the destination directory to
be atomic. Note, however, that in practice looking up directories that
contain <tt>..</tt> is usually not quite atomic.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>open</tt> returns a nonnegative file handle. On error,
-1 is returned, and <A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to
the error encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=15>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>ENODEV</td>
				<td>The device prefix of <em>filename</em> did
				not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOTDIR</td>	<td>A non-final component of <em>filename</em>
				was not a directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOENT</td>	<td>A non-final component of <em>filename</em>
				did not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOENT</td>	<td>The named file does not exist, and O_CREAT
				was not specified.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EEXIST</td>	<td>The named file exists, and O_EXCL was
				specified.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EISDIR</td>	<td>The named object is a directory, and it
				was to be opened for writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EMFILE</td>	<td>The process's file table was full, or a
				process-specific limit on open files
				was reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENFILE</td>	<td>The system file table is full, if such a
				thing exists, or a system-wide limit
				on open files was reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENXIO</td>	<td>The named object is a block device with no
				filesystem mounted on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOSPC</td>	<td>The file was to be created, and the
				filesystem involved is full.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EINVAL</td>	<td><em>flags</em> contained invalid
				values.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EIO</td>	<td>A hard I/O error occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EFAULT</td>	<td><em>filename</em> was an invalid
				pointer.</td></tr>
