<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
symlink - create symbolic link
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>symlink(const char *</tt><em>oldname</em><tt>,
const char *</tt><em>linkname</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>symlink</tt> creates a symbolic link. The symlink itself is named
<em>linkname</em>, and it points to <em>oldname</em>.
</p>

<p>
<em>oldname</em> need not exist or be on the same filesystem.
</p>

<p>
The call (like all system calls) must be atomic; that is, the symlink
should either be created or not created, and no other process should
see an intermediate state (such as, for example, a blank symlink whose
name hasn't been written out yet...) For recoverable file systems,
this includes after crash recovery.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>symlink</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
