<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
__vprintf - printf backend
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>__vprintf(void (*</tt><em>func</em><tt>)(void
				*</tt><em>clientdata</em><tt>,
				const char *</tt><em>str</em><tt>,
				size_t </tt><em>len</em><tt>),
          void *</tt><em>clientdata</em><tt>,
          const char *</tt><em>format</em><tt>,
          va_list)</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In OS/161, __vprintf is the back-end engine for
<A HREF=printf.html>printf</A> and printf-like functions.
Note that it is not portable - application code should use
<A HREF=snprintf.html>snprintf or vsnprintf</A> when implementing
their own printf-like functions. This documentation is provided for
use when extending OS/161 itself.
</p>

<p>
The <em>format</em> and subsequent arguments are treated as described
under <A HREF=printf.html>printf</A>.
</p>

<p>
The <em>func</em> argument is called to print text generated by the
formatting process. The <em>clientdata</em> argument is passed
straight through __vprintf to <em>func</em>. The <em>str</em> argument
to func points to some text that is to be printed; the <em>len</em>
argument is the length of that string, which should not be assumed to
be null-terminated.
</p>

<p>
The strings passed to <em>func</em> may be small; if printing is
expensive buffering is probably wanted.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
__vprintf returns the number of characters printed.
