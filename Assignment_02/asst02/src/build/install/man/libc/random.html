<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
random - pseudorandom number generation
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>long</tt><br>
<tt>random(void);</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>void</tt><br>
<tt>srandom(unsigned long </tt><em>seed</em><tt>);</tt><br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>random</tt> returns a number between 0 and 0x7fffffff. This
number is selected using a rather complex generator which is believed
to generate randomness of an acceptable (though not cryptographic)
quality. Unlike with some generators, all bits of the values returned
are random.
</p>

<p>
<tt>srandom</tt> initializes the generator state based on the
passed-in <em>seed</em>. If <tt>srandom</tt> is not called, the
sequence of numbers returned by <tt>random</tt> is the same as if
<tt>srandom</tt> had been called with a <em>seed</em> of 1.
</p>

<p>
The symbolic constant <tt>RAND_MAX</tt> is provided to hold the
maximum value 0x7fffffff.
This is technically incorrect as the name <tt>RAND_MAX</tt> is
properly part of a different random number interface.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of <tt>random</tt> and <tt>srandom</tt> used in
OS/161 is software developed by the University of California, Berkeley
and its contributors.
