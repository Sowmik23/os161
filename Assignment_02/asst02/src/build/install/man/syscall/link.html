<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
link - create hard link to a file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>link(const char *</tt><em>oldname</em><tt>,
const char *</tt><em>newname</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>link</tt> creates a new name, <em>newname</em>, for the file
referred to by <em>oldname</em>. Henceforth, both names are equally
valid ways to refer to the same file. The file is only deleted when
all names are removed. This is a "hard link".
</p>

<p>
The creation of the new name is atomic. The two names must be on the
same filesystem. Directories may not be hard-linked.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>link</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and <A
HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
