<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
ftruncate - set size of a file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>ftruncate(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>, off_t </tt><em>filesize</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>ftruncate</tt> forcibly sets the size of the file referred to by
<em>fd</em> to <em>filesize</em>. If this expands the file, the new
data appears as if it is zero-filled. (On file systems that support
sparse files, the new space does not need to be physically allocated.)
If the action shrinks the file, the excess data is discarded.
</p>

<p>
The file must be open for write.
</p>

<p>
<tt>ftruncate</tt> must be atomic. For recoverable file systems, this
includes after crashing and running recovery.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>ftruncate</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned,
and <A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>EBADF</td>
				<td><em>fd</em> is not a valid file handle, or
				it is not open for writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EIO</td>	<td>A hard I/O error occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EFAULT</td>	<td><em>buf</em> points to an invalid
				address.</td></tr>
