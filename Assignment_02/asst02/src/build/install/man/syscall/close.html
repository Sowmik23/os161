<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
close - close file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>close(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The file handle <em>fd</em> is closed. The same file handle may then
be returned again from <A HREF=open.html>open</A>,
<A HREF=dup2.html>dup2</A>, <A HREF=pipe.html>pipe</A>, or similar
calls.
</p>

<p>
Other file handles are not affected in any way, even if they are
attached to the same file.
</p>

<p>
According to POSIX, even if the underlying operation fails, the file
is closed anyway and the file handle becomes invalid.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, close returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=10>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10%>EBADF</td>
			<td><em>fd</em> is not a valid file handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>EIO</td>	<td>A hard I/O error occurred.</td></tr>
</table>
