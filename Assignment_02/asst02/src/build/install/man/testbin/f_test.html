<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
f_test - basic concurrent filesystem test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/f_test</tt> [<tt>1</tt>|<tt>2</tt>|<tt>3</tt>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> consists of three tests, 1-3, that can be specified on
the command line. If nothing is specified, all three tests are run.
</p>

<p>
Test 1 writes a large file (a bit over 270k) and reads it back.
</p>

<p>
Test 2 creates and removes a directory tree, rather like
<A HREF=dirtest.html>dirtest</A>.
</p>

<p>
Test 3 spawns three subprocesses that simultaneously read and write
the same file.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/mkdir.html>mkdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rmdir.html>rmdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> should run correctly once the file system assignment
is complete.
</p>
