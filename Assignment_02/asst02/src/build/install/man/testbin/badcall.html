<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
badcall - make invalid system calls
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/badcall</tt> [<em>test...</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>badcall</tt> contains a variety of tests for system call error
conditions and error handling. The tests are grouped by system call;
all available tests for a particular system call are run when that
system call is selected.
</p>

<p>
None of the tests should crash the system. If you kill processes when
system calls fail with EFAULT (a valid thing to do) <tt>badcall</tt>
itself may get killed. Otherwise, <tt>badcall</tt> should not get
killed either.
</p>

<p>
Tests may be selected on the command line; if so, all the tests
selected on the command line will be run in order. If nothing is
selected on the command line, a menu is printed and tests are prompted
for.
</p>

<p>
The tests for the individual syscalls are specified with the letters
`a' through `y'. A single-digit number may also be specified; this
tests all the system calls that are supposed to work once the
corresponding assignment is completed. `*' may be used to test
everything. Use `!' to quit.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>badcall</tt> can test every system call. It requires
<A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A> and
<A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A> itself to work properly, and
some of the tests may use syscalls other than the ones being tested.
</p>

<p>
At the completion of each assignment, the system should pass the tests
for the syscalls associated with that (and previous) assignments. At
no time should anything <tt>badcall</tt> does crash the system.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, your course staff will have updated the copy of
<tt>badcall</tt> you received with OS/161 to reflect the system calls
required in each of the assignments in your course. In practice, this
will probably not be the case. It is likely a better idea to test each
system call explicitly than rely on the per-assignment lists.
