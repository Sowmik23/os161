<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
ln - link files
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/ln</tt> <em>oldfile</em> <em>newfile</em>
<br>
<tt>/bin/ln -s</tt> <em>oldfile</em> <em>newfile</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
ln creates links to files. The first usage creates a hard link, that
is, an additional name for the <em>same</em> file. The second
usage, with the -s option, creates a symbolic link, a special
filesystem entry that redirects accesses back to the first original
file.
</p>

<p>
The symlink created is of the form <em>newfile</em> -> <em>oldfile</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note that <tt>ln</tt> does <em>not</em> support the Unix idiom
<tt>ln file1 file2 ... destination-dir</tt> to link a number of files
at once. In particular, <tt>ln foo bar/</tt> will fail, probably with
"Is a directory".
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>ln</tt> uses the following syscalls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/link.html>link</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/symlink.html>symlink</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>ln</tt> without the -s option should work once (or if) you
implement hard links. <tt>ln</tt> with the -s option should work once
(or if) you implement symbolic links. Check your assignments for when
(or if) you need to implement these features.
</p>

<p>
<tt>ln</tt> is able to create symlinks even if hard links are not
implemented, and vice versa.
