<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
pwd - print working directory
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/pwd</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>pwd</tt> prints the current working directory.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>pwd</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/__getcwd.html>__getcwd</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
pwd should function properly once the basic system calls assignment is
completed, except on filesystems or in directories that do not support
getcwd.
Note that by default <A HREF=../dev/emu.html>emufs</A> does not
support getcwd except in its root directory.
</p>

<p>
<tt>pwd</tt> should function properly in all directories of your
filesystem once the file system assignment is completed.
</p>
