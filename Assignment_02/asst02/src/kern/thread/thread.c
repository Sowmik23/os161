	 *
	 *    - If newstate is S_ZOMB we never get back here in that
	 *      context at all.

	 *    - If the thread just chosen to run ("next") was a new
	 *      thread, we don't get to this code again until
	 *      *another* context switch happens, because when new
	 *      threads return from switchframe_switch they teleport
	 *      to thread_startup.
	 *
	 *    - At this point the thread whose stack we're now on may
	 *      have been migrated to another cpu since it last ran.
	 *
	 * The above is inherently confusing and will probably take a
	 * while to get used to.
	 *
	 * However, the important part is that code placed here, after
	 * the call to switchframe_switch, does not necessarily run on
