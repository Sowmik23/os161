<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>strcmp(const char *</tt><em>str1</em><tt>,
const char *</tt><em>str2</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The two strings <em>str1</em> and <em>str2</em> are compared
lexicographically.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
If <em>str1</em> sorts before <em>str2</em>, -1 is returned.
</p>
<p>
If <em>str1</em> sorts after <em>str2</em>, 1 is returned.

If <em>str1</em> is the same as <em>str2</em>, 0 is returned.

The sort order used is derived from the natural ordering of
the numerical values of (unsigned) characters.
