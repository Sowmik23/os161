<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
mkdir - create directory
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>mkdir(const char *</tt><em>pathname</em><tt>,
mode_t </tt><em>mode</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>mkdir</tt> creates a directory named <em>name</em>, where
<em>name</em> is the last filename component in <em>pathname</em>. All
the directories named in the prefix portion of <em>pathname</em> must
exist and must in fact be directories, not ordinary files. The name
<em>name</em> must not already exist. The new directory must be
created atomically.
</p>

<p>
The <em>mode</em> argument gives the file permissions to use and can
be ignored in OS/161.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>mkdir</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
