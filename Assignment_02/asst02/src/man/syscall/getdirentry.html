<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
getdirentry - read filename from directory
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>getdirentry(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>, char *</tt><em>buf</em><tt>,
size_t </tt><em>buflen</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>getdirentry</tt> retrieves the next filename from a directory
referred to by the file handle <em>filehandle</em>. The name is stored
in <em>buf</em>, an area of size <em>buflen</em>. The length of of the
name actually found is returned.
</p>

<p>
Note: this call behaves like read() - the name stored in <em>buf</em>
is not null-terminated.
</p>

<p>
Which filename is the "next" is chosen based on the seek pointer
associated with the file handle. The meaning of the seek pointer on a
directory is defined by the filesystem in use and should not be
interpreted - the only ways in which <A HREF=lseek.html>lseek</A>
should be used are with SEEK_SET and an offset previously returned by
lseek, or with any of SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_EOF with an offset
of 0.
</p>

<p>
<tt>getdirentry</tt> (like all system calls) should be atomic. In this
case this means that each <tt>getdirentry</tt> call should return a
name that was in the directory at the point in time when the call
happened relative to other calls. <tt>getdirentry</tt> should never
return names that have only been partially written or that have been
partially erased.
Note that the kernel is not obliged to (and generally cannot) make the
getdirentry call atomic with respect to other threads in the same
process accessing the transfer buffer during the operation.
</p>

<p>
In general it is desirable for directory iteration to be stable; that
is, opening a directory and reading it should yield a consistent
snapshot of the directory state. Implementing this is a nuisance in
general, and is worse in OS/161 since the system call we have can only
return one name at a time. Therefore, it isn't required by default.
(However, always check your course materials for the official word,
just in case.)
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>getdirentry</tt> returns the length of the name
transferred.  On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>
