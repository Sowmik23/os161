<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
ioctl - miscellaneous device I/O operations
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>ioctl(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>, int </tt><em>code</em><tt>,
void *</tt><em>data</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>ioctl</tt> performs an object-specific operation <em>code</em> on
the object referred to by the file handle <em>fd</em>. The
<em>data</em> argument may point to supplemental data required or
returned by the operation. The size of buffer required, if any, and
other such matters are operation-specific.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, ioctl is a catchall function for performing operations
that don't fit neatly into any other model.
</p>

<p>
The ioctl codes are defined in &lt;kern/ioctl.h&gt;, which should be
included via &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt; by user-level code. As of this
writing, the base OS/161 system defines no ioctls. However, it may
prove useful to implement some, particularly in connection with some
less conventional possible projects.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>ioctl</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>

    <td width=10% valign=top>EBADF</td>
				<td><em>fd</em> was not a valid file
				handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EIOCTL</td>	<td><em>code</em> was an invalid ioctl for the
				object referenced.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EFAULT</td>	<td><em>data</em> was required by the
				operation requested, but was an
				invalid pointer.</td></tr>
