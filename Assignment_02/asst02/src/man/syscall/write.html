<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
write - write data to file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>ssize_t</tt><br>
<tt>write(int </tt><em>fd</em><tt>, const void *</tt><em>buf</em><tt>,
size_t </tt><em>nbytes</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>write</tt> writes up to <em>buflen</em> bytes to the file
specified by <em>fd</em>, at the location in the file specified by the
current seek position of the file, taking the data from the space
pointed to by <em>buf</em>. The file must be open for writing.
</p>

<p>
The current seek position of the file is advanced by the number of
bytes written.
</p>

<p>
Each write (or <A HREF=read.html>read</A>) operation is atomic
relative to other I/O to the same file.
Note that the kernel is not obliged to (and generally cannot) make the
write atomic with respect to other threads in the same process
accessing the I/O buffer during the write.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
The count of bytes written is returned. This count should be
positive. A return value of 0 means that nothing could be written,
but that no error occurred; this only occurs at end-of-file on
fixed-size objects. On error, <tt>write</tt> returns -1 and sets
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> to a suitable error code for the error
condition encountered.
</p>

<p>
Note that in some cases, particularly on devices, fewer than
<em>buflen</em> (but greater than zero) bytes may be written. This
depends on circumstances and does not necessarily signify
end-of-file. In most cases, one should loop to make sure that all
output has actually been written.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
