<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
semfs - semaphore filesystem
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
options semfs
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
semfs is a simple "fake" (memory-only) file system that provides
synchronization facilities to userland in the form of counting
semaphores.
There is one semfs instance, called "sem:", which is created and
mounted during system boot.
</p>

<p>
Semaphores in semfs appear as files in "sem:". To create a semaphore,
open such a file using <tt>O_CREAT</tt>. To destroy it, remove it with
<tt>remove()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
To use the semaphore, write one byte to increase the semaphore count
by one (the "V" operation) and write one byte to decrease the
semaphore count by one (the "P" operation). The count will not
decrease below zero; attempts to do so will block until other
concurrent write operations raise the count again.
You can also set the count explicitly using <tt>ftruncate()</tt>; this
is useful for initializing a semaphore to a nonzero value. Note that
no data is actually transferred by the read and write calls; it is
acceptable to pass NULL as the data pointer.
</p>

<p>
You can create as many semaphores as you want (until memory runs out
or the directory reaches 2^32 entries); however, semfs does not
support subdirectories, hard links of semaphores, or renaming.
