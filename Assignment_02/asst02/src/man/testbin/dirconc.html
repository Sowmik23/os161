<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
dirconc - concurrent file system test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/dirconc</tt> <em>path</em> [<em>randomseed</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>dirconc</tt> does random directory operations from many processes
concurrently. This is a fairly difficult stress test as it exercises
cross-directory rename. Quite a number of real-world systems have
failed to handle it or larger/longer builds of it.
</p>

<p>
It does its work in a subdirectory of <em>path</em>, so you can run it
against whatever filesystem you prefer.
</p>

<p>
If your system survives a <tt>dirconc</tt> run, be sure to check the
integrity of the filesystem as well. It's not uncommon for
<tt>dirconc</tt> to provoke filesystem corruption.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>dirconc</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/getpid.html>getpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/mkdir.html>mkdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rmdir.html>rmdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/chdir.html>chdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rename.html>rename</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>dirconc</tt> should work properly on SFS once the file system
assignment is complete. It won't do much of interest on emufs,
however.
