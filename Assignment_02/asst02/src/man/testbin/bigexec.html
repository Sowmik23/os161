<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
bigexec - test exec with large argv blocks
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/bigexec</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigexec</tt> tests a number of different possible ways to call
<A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A> with large or largish argv
blocks.
</p>

<p>
Note that <tt>bigexec</tt> works by execing itself with various
arguments.
To start the test, run it without arguments.
Passing it other arguments will likely confuse it.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigexec</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>bigexec</tt> should work once you have implemented the basic
system calls, including of course execv.
(But it depends on little other than execv, making it useful in the
early stages.)
