<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
dirseek - seek on directories test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/dirseek</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>dirseek</tt> creates a test directory, creates some files in it,
and lists the directory repeatedly, seeking in a variety of ways (some
legal, some not).
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>dirseek</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/chdir.html>chdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/getdirentry.html>getdirentry</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/mkdir.html>mkdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rmdir.html>rmdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>dirseek</tt> should run (on SFS filesystems) when the file system
assignment is complete. It will not run on emufs, because emufs does
not support <tt>mkdir</tt> or <tt>rmdir</tt>.
</p>
