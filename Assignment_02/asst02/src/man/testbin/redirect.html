<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
redirect - test I/O redirection
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/redirect</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>redirect</tt> does a simple test of I/O redirection like a Unix
shell might do.
It first creates an input test file, then invokes
<A HREF=../bin/cat.html>cat</A> to copy it, with standard input and
standard output suitably redirected.
Then it checks that the copy happened correctly, and removes the test
files.
</p>

<p>
The specifications of Unix system calls are such that this program
should take no extra work to support once basic tests show that the
pieces are working.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>redirect</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/dup2.html>dup2</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>redirect</tt> should work once you have implemented the basic
system calls, including fork, exec, and wait.
</p>

<p>
Note that until you implement remove (which is typically not part of
the basic system calls assignment), and in any case on emufs, the test
files will not get removed.
This is not important, just untidy.
