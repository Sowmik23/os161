<h2 align=center>bigseek</h2>
<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
bigseek - test 64-bit seek positions
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/bigseek</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigseek</tt> tests manipulation of seek pointers past
2<sup>31</sup>.
It is somewhat limited in what it can do, because neither SFS nor
emufs supports files larger than 2<sup>32</sup> bytes; but it can
still seek around and check that the resulting seek position is
reported correctly.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigseek</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>read</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>remove</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>bigseek</tt> should work once you have implemented the basic
system calls.
Until you implement remove, it will not be able to delete its test
file; this is merely untidy, not a problem.
