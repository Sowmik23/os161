<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
sparsefile - generate a sparse file
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/sparsefile</tt> <em>filename</em> <em>size</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>sparsefile</tt> generates a sparse file (a file where most of the
file is unallocated space) of the requested <em>size</em> by writing
one byte to the end of it.
The resulting file should use one block for data, and depending on the
size (and the file system implementation) some small number of blocks
for metadata.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>sparsefile</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>sparsefile</tt> will work once you have implemented the basic
system calls, but will be most useful when working on the file
system.
