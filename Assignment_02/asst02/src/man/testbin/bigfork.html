<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
bigfork - large forking test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/bigfork</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigfork</tt> is a combination of
the <A HREF=forktest.html>forktest</A>
and <A HREF=parallelvm.html>parallelvm</A> tests.
It forks geometrically like forktest, but more times (it goes six
deep instead of four) and in between each it does some aimless matrix
operations similar to those in parallelvm.
It was written to try to come up with a test that generates lots of
processes (like parallelvm) but works better as a benchmark than
parallelvm does.
It is only modestly successful; multiple runs of bigfork still
typically give a moderately high variance; but as multiple runs of
parallelvm typically exhibit a huge variance it's a step forward.
</p>

<p>
It uses about 4M of memory, which is bigger than parallelvm but
comparable to some of the other VM stress tests.
When run in-core it also offers a limited ability to test the
multiprocessor scalability of your VM system.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>bigfork</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>bigfork</tt> should run correctly to completion once the VM
assignment is complete.
