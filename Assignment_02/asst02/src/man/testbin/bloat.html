<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
bloat - waste memory
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/bloat</tt>
[<tt>-a </tt><em>allocs</em>]
[<tt>-b </tt><em>bias</em>]
[<tt>-p </tt><em>touchpages</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>bloat</tt> allocates all available memory one page at a time until
it runs out.
Unlike other tests that do this, it has been gimmicked up so that it
runs in a fairly reasonable amount of time even when swapping.
</p>

<p>
It runs in cycles; every cycle it allocates <em>allocs</em> pages, one
at a time, by calling <A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A> (not
<A HREF=../libc/malloc.html>malloc</A>), then touches <em>touchpages</em>
pages.
It chooses the pages it touches as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
1 in 1000 pages are chosen uniformly from the entire allocated space.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The rest are taken from the middle 1% of the space; note that this
range shifts upwards as more pages are allocated.
</p></li>
<li><p>
It rolls <em>bias</em> dice to pick pages from the middle 1%.
The more dice, the tighter the distribution it picks and the
faster it runs.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The default settings are 4 <em>allocs</em>, 8 <em>touchpages</em>
and a <em>bias</em> of 8.
This gives reasonable performance with reasonable amounts of memory on
the solution set.
There are enough things affecting the speed that you may want to
experiment with the settings when testing on your own VM system.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>bloat</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>bloat</tt> should work once you have implemented your VM system
and added the sbrk system call.
It may not run fast by default, but it should always be faster than
<A HREF=sbrktest.html>sbrktest</A> 10 or the notoriously glacial
<A HREF=malloctest.html>malloctest</A> 3.
