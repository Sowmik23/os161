<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
mkdir - create directory
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/mkdir</tt> <em>directory</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>mkdir</tt> creates the named directory. All intermediate
components must already exist. If the named directory already exists,
an error occurs.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>mkdir</tt> uses the following syscalls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/mkdir.html>mkdir</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As the mkdir system call is generally not part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>mkdir</tt> will usually still not function after
the basic system calls assignment is complete.
This call is typically part of a later assignment, usually the file
system assignment. You may also need to implement subdirectories in
the file system.
Consult your course materials for specific information.
