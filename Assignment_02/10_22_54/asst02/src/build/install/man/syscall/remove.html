<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
remove - delete (unlink) a file
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>remove(const char *</tt><em>pathname</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The name of the file referred to by <em>pathname</em> is removed from
the filesystem. The actual file itself is not removed until no further
references to it exist, whether those references are on disk or in
memory.
</p>

<p>
It is an error for <em>pathname</em> to not specify an existing file
or to refer to a directory.
</p>

<p>
The call (like all system calls) should be atomic. Other processes
should not be able to see a half-removed file. If implementing a
recoverable filesystem, recovery must yield a volume where the
<tt>remove</tt> either has been fully completed or has not been done
at all.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>remove</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.
