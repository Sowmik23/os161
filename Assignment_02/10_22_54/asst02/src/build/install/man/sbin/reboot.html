<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
reboot - reboot system
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/sbin/reboot</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

as <A HREF=halt.html>halt</A>.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>reboot</tt> uses the <A HREF=../syscall/reboot.html>reboot</A>
system call.
</p>

<p>
<tt>reboot</tt> will function properly even before you do any work on
OS/161.
