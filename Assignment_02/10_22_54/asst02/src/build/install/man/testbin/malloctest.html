<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
malloctest - some simple tests for userlevel malloc
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/malloctest</tt> [<em>test</em>...]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>malloctest</tt> contains 7 tests, 1-7. These may be run
interactively or from the command line.
</p>

<p>
Test 1 checks if all the bytes we ask for actually get allocated.
</p>

<p>
Test 2 checks if <tt>malloc</tt> gracefully handles failing requests.
This test assumes that <tt>malloc</tt> will eventually fail if one
keeps allocating enough memory, instead of promising memory it can't
deliver and then (perhaps) killing processes when it runs out. More
detail regarding this condition can be found in comments in the source
code.
</p>

<p>
Test 3 also checks if <tt>malloc</tt> gracefully handles failing
requests, and thus has the same restrictions as test 2.
</p>

<p>
Test 4 attempts to check if <tt>malloc</tt> coalesces the free list
properly.  This test is only meant for first-fit, next-fit, or
best-fit allocators; anything else will most likely confuse it.
Running test 4 after other tests may confuse it as well.
</p>

<p>
Tests 5-7 are a randomized stress test. Test 5 uses pseudorandom seed
0. Test 6 seeds the random generator from the
<A HREF=../dev/random.html>random:</A> device. Test 7 prompts you for a
specific seed.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>malloctest</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Your system should pass all the <tt>malloctest</tt> tests, subject to
the conditions described above, once you have implemented
<A HREF=../syscalls/sbrk.html>sbrk</A>.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
Because OS/161 ships with a userlevel <tt>malloc</tt> implementation
now, rather than making you write one, this test is not very useful.
</p>

<p>
Because the userlevel <tt>malloc</tt> OS/161 ships with is quite dumb,
test 3 can be amazingly slow.
