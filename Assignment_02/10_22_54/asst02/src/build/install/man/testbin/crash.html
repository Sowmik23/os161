<h2 align=center>crash</h2>
<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
crash - commit various exceptions
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/crash</tt> [<em>operation</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>crash</tt> will perform any one of fourteen illegal processor
operations, any one of which should get it killed without causing the
whole system to crash.
</p>

<p>
The operations are coded <tt>a</tt> through <tt>n</tt> and may be
chosen on the command line. If no operation is chosen, a menu is
displayed and a choice solicited.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
Test <tt>f</tt>, which writes into the process's own code segment,
will only cause a processor exception if you implement read-only code
segments. Since this is not required, it is not required that test
<tt>f</tt> pass.
</p>

<p>
However, using test <tt>f</tt> must not under any circumstances
corrupt the code in the copy of <tt>crash</tt> on disk!
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>crash</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>crash</tt> should operate properly once the basic system call
assignment is complete.
</p>
