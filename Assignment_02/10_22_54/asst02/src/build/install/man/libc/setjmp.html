<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
setjmp, longjmp - non-local jump operations
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>setjmp(jmp_buf </tt><em>jb</em>)<tt>;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>void</tt><br>
<tt>longjmp(jmp_buf </tt><em>jb</em><tt>,
int </tt><em>returncode</em>)<tt>;</tt><br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>setjmp</tt> saves the current stack frame and processor state in
<em>jb</em>. A subsequent call to <tt>longjmp</tt> with the same
<em>jb</em> causes execution to jump to where <tt>setjmp</tt> was
called from.
</p>

<p>
If the stack frame that called <tt>setjmp</tt> returns before
<tt>longjmp</tt> is called, the results are undefined.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
When called, <tt>setjmp</tt> returns 0. When <tt>longjmp</tt> is
called, it does not itself return, but instead causes <tt>setjmp</tt>
to appear to return again, this time returning <em>returncode</em>.
</p>

<p>
If zero is passed as <em>returncode</em>, the value 1 is used instead.
