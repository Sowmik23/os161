<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
strtok_r - tokenize string reentrantly
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>char *</tt><br>
<tt>strtok_r(char *</tt><em>string</em><tt>,
const char *</tt><em>separators</em><tt>,
char **</tt><em>context</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>strtok_r</tt> is a reentrant version of <A
HREF=strtok.html>strtok</A>. It behaves the same way, except that the
internal state is kept using the <em>context</em> parameter rather
than being global.
</p>

<p>
The value passed to the <em>context</em> parameter should be the
address of a <tt>char *</tt> whose value is preserved between
successive related calls to strtok_r. The <tt>char *</tt> need not be
initialized before the first call, and its value should not be
inspected.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
<tt>strtok_r</tt> returns successive components of the passed-in
string, and <tt>NULL</tt> when no more remain.
