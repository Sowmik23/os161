<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
rm - remove (unlink) files
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/rm</tt> <em>file...</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>rm</tt> deletes the files specified on its command line. (If one
of the filenames specified is one of several hard links to the same
file, the file is only removed erased when all links to it are
deleted.)
</p>

<p>
Using <tt>rm</tt> on directories produces an error. Use
<A HREF=rmdir.html>rmdir</A> to remove directories.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>rm</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>

<p>
As the remove system call is generally not part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>rm</tt> will usually still not function after
the basic system calls assignment is complete.
This call is typically part of a later assignment, usually the file
system assignment.
Consult your course materials for specific information.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
<A HREF=../dev/emu.html>emufs</A> does not support <tt>rm</tt>. (This is
intentional.)
</p>
