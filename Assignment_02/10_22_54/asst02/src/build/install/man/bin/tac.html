<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
<tt>tac</tt> - print in reverse order
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/tac</tt> <em>files...</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>tac</tt> prints the files listed on its command line in reverse
order to its standard output. If the magic filename "-" is
encountered, <tt>tac</tt> prints its standard input up to the first
EOF. Each file is printed backwards in line-by-line fashion.
</p>

<p>
With no arguments, <tt>tac</tt> prints its standard input.
</p>

<p>
<tt>tac</tt> takes no options.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
<tt>tac</tt> uses the following syscalls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/getpid.html>getpid</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>tac</tt> should function properly once the basic system calls
assignment is completed. However, until the file system assignment is
done and the <A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A> system call
implemented, it will leave two scratch files behind per invocation.
