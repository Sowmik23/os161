<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
mv - rename or move files
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/mv</tt> <em>oldname</em> <em>newname</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>mv</tt> renames the filesystem object specified by
<em>oldname</em> so that it is subsequently named <em>newname</em>.
Both files and directories can be renamed or moved into other parts of
the filesystem tree. However, devices may not be renamed and
filesystem objects may not be moved across filesystems.
</p>

<p>
<tt>mv</tt> accepts no options.
</p>

<p>
Note that <tt>mv</tt> does <em>not</em> support the Unix idiom
<tt>mv file1 file2 ... destination-dir</tt> to move a number of files
at once. In particular, <tt>mv foo bar/</tt> will fail, probably with
"Is a directory".
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>mv</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/rename.html>rename</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As the rename system call is generally not part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>mv</tt> will usually still not function after
the basic system calls assignment is complete.
This call is typically part of a later assignment, usually the file
system assignment.
Once you implement the system call you should be able to rename
objects within the same directory.
To move things between directories you will need to implement
cross-directory support for rename at the file system layer.
This may or may not be part of your file system assignment;
consult your course materials for specific information.
