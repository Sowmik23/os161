<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
stat - get file state information
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>stat(const char *</tt><em>pathname</em><tt>,
struct stat *</tt><em>statbuf</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>stat</tt> retrieves status information about the file referred to
by <em>pathname</em> and stores it in the stat structure pointed to by
<em>statbuf</em>.
</p>

<p>
The call (like all system calls) should be atomic; that is, the
information retrieved should come from a single point in time.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
On success, <tt>stat</tt> returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not
mentioned here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=5>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>ENODEV</td>
				<td>The device prefix of <em>filename</em> did
				not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOTDIR</td>	<td>A non-final component of <em>pathname</em>
				was not a directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ENOENT</td>	<td>The named file does not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EIO</td>	<td>A hard I/O error occurred.</td></tr>
