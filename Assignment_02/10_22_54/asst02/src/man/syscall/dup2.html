<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
dup2 - clone file handles
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>int</tt><br>
<tt>dup2(int </tt><em>oldfd</em><tt>, int </tt><em>newfd</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>dup2</tt> clones the file handle <em>oldfd</em> onto the file
handle <em>newfd</em>. If <em>newfd</em> names an already-open file,
that file is closed.
</p>

<p>
The two handles refer to the same "open" of the file -- that is,
they are references to the same object and share the same seek
pointer. Note that this is different from opening the same file
twice.
</p>

<p>
dup2 is most commonly used to relocate opened files onto
<tt>STDIN_FILENO</tt>, <tt>STDOUT_FILENO</tt>, and/or
<tt>STDERR_FILENO</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Both filehandles must be non-negative, and, if applicable, smaller
than the maximum allowed file handle number.
</p>

<p>
The call (like all system calls) should be atomic; for single-threaded
processes this is trivial.
Multithreaded processes should never e.g. see an intermediate state
where <em>newfd</em> has been closed but <em>oldfd</em> has not yet
been cloned onto it.
Similarly, if two threads attempt e.g. <tt>dup2(3, 4)</tt> and
<tt>dup2(4, 3)</tt> simultaneously, the results must be equivalent to
one of the calls completing before the other starts.
</p>

<p>
Using dup2 to clone a file handle onto itself has no effect.
</p>

<p>
(The "2" in "dup2" arises from the existence of an older and less
powerful Unix system call "dup".)
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
<tt>dup2</tt> returns <em>newfd</em>. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>

<p>
The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other cases not mentioned
here.

<table width=90%>
<tr><td width=5% rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=10% valign=top>EBADF</td>
				<td><em>oldfd</em> is not a valid file
				handle, or <em>newfd</em> is a value
				that cannot be a valid file
				handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EMFILE</td>	<td>The process's file table was full, or a
				process-specific limit on open files
				was reached.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>ENFILE</td>	<td>The system's file table was full,
				if such a thing is possible, or a
				global limit on open files was
				reached.</td></tr>
</table>
