<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
lscreen - LAMEbus memory-mapped screen
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
device lscreen* at lamebus*
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
lscreen is the driver for the LAMEbus memory-mapped screen
card. It does not provide any internal input buffering; that is
expected to happen at a higher level.
</p>

<p>
Since the memory-mapped screen card is not actually available yet as
of this writing, the driver has not been tested and probably does not
work.
</p>

<p>
The <A HREF=con.html>system console</A> device can be attached to an
lscreen instance.
