<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
emu - emulator pass-through filesystem
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
device emu* at lamebus*
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
emu, also known as emufs, is a driver for a special-purpose System/161
device that provides access to the filesystem System/161 is running
atop. It provides the appearance of a mounted filesystem.
</p>

<p>
It is not recommended to access the same underlying files through
different instances of emufs.
</p>

<h3>Files</h3>
<p>
<tt>emu0:</tt>, <tt>emu1:</tt>, etc.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
emufs does not restrict access to the host directory tree under and
including its root directory. This is so symbolic links out of this
tree work without requiring special handling.
</p>

<p>
A number of file system operations, most notably remove and rmdir, are
not supported.
