<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
schedpong - scheduler pong
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/schedpong</tt> [<em>options...</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>schedpong</tt> forks a number of processes that do different kinds
of work.
This can be used to evaluate the behavior of your scheduler under
different conditions.
</p>

<p>
There are three kinds of jobs in schedpong:
<ul>
<li>Thinkers</li>
<li>Grinders</li>
<li>Pong groups</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A thinker job is one CPU-bound process: it loops computing and doesn't
sleep for I/O or use much memory.
</p>

<p>
A grinder job is one memory-bound process: it loops accessing lots of
memory, similar to the various VM stress tests.
</p>

<p>
A pong group job is a family of I/O-bound processes.
An arbitrary number of processes play scheduler pong using the user
semaphores (semfs), each process signalling the next.
</p>

<p>
By choosing different numbers of thinkers, pong groups, and grinders,
and adjusting the pong group size, one can evaluate how well a
scheduler does under different conditions.
In general schedulers should be favoring the pong groups in order to
minimize the response latency of the semaphore ponging, but without
starving the thinkers.
Adding grinders to the mix lets your deal with what happens when you
also have swapping going on, which is a complicated situation not
handled well by textbook algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to have a real VM system (not dumbvm) to use
grinders.
With dumbvm you may also need to configure a fair amount of memory to
get all the intended processes to fork successfully.
</p>

<p>
Options:
<dl>
<dt>-t N</dt><dd>Configure N thinkers. (default 2)</dd>
<dt>-g N</dt><dd>Configure N grinders. (default 0)</dd>
<dt>-p N</dt><dd>Configure N pong groups. (default 1)</dd>
<dt>-s N</dt><dd>Set the pong group size to N. (default 6)</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>schedpong</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/__time.html>__time</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/remove.html>remove</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/sbrk.html>sbrk</A></li>
</ul>
Only the grinder jobs use sbrk, and remove is only used for cleaning
up.
</p>

<p>
However, note that schedpong relies heavily on the user semaphores;
if they do not work (owing e.g. to bugs in open/read/write) schedpong
will not work either.
Make sure <A HREF=usemtest.html>usemtest</A> runs (at least up to the
"shoot" test, even if that part doesn't) before spending time on
schedpong.
</p>

<p>
<tt>schedpong</tt> without grinders should work once you have
implemented the basic system calls and they work reliably
(particularly fork).
<tt>schedpong</tt> with grinders should work once you have implemented
the sbrk system call and a virtual memory system that supports dynamic
memory allocation.
