<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
farm - run some hogs and cats
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/farm</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>farm</tt> runs three copies of <A HREF=hog.html>hog</A> and one
copy of <A HREF=../bin/cat.html>/bin/cat</A>.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>cat</tt> process reads and prints the file <tt>catfile</tt>,
which you should create in advance.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>farm</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>cat</tt> subprocess spawned by <tt>farm</tt> uses these
additional system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<tt>farm</tt> is only likely to be useful for testing the scheduler.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
<tt>farm</tt> does not wait for its child processes to finish.
</p>
