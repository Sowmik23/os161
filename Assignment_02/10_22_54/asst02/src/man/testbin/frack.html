<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
frack - file system crack
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/frack</tt> <tt>list</tt><br>
<tt>/testbin/frack</tt> <tt>do</tt> <em>workload</em> [<em>arg</em>]<br>
<tt>/testbin/frack</tt> <tt>check</tt> <em>workload</em> [<em>arg</em>]<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>frack</tt> is a general-purpose file system checker.
It has a number of workloads built into it (currently 58, some of
which are families of related workloads), each of which can be run in
either <tt>do</tt> mode or <tt>check</tt> mode.
</p>

<p>
In <tt>do</tt> mode, <tt>frack</tt> executes the chosen workload
against the file system.
</p>

<p>
In <tt>check</tt> mode, <tt>frack</tt> executes the chosen workload
against an internal model of a file system, and builds a
representation of all the successive states the file system reaches.
Then it inspects the file system it is run on and matches its state
against this representation.
It finds the closest matching state, and then prints out the
discrepancies it finds between that state and what it sees.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <tt>check</tt> mode expects that the <tt>do</tt> mode
was run on an empty (newly formatted) file system volume.
Otherwise, any other stuff on the volume will appear as a discrepancy
and may cause the state matching algorithm to fail.
</p>

<p>
The intended use is for testing file system recovery: run a workload
in <tt>do</tt> mode, crash during the workload (e.g. using the
System/161 doom counter), run file system recovery, then run the same
workload in <tt>check</tt> mode.
Ideally, the <tt>check</tt> mode run will find the resulting on-disk
state after recovery to exactly match some valid state the workload
reached.
In practice, some forms of discrepancy are often considered
acceptable; your course staff should give you guidance on what you are
and are not required to handle.
</p>

<p>
Note that you probably want to get your recovery code to the point
where it reliably produces a valid, self-consistent volume that
<A HREF=../sbin/sfsck.html>sfsck</A> accepts before worrying about
whether the <tt>frack check</tt> phase passes.
</p>

<p>
<tt>frack</tt> can also be used for testing the general correctness of
a file system, such as by running the <tt>do</tt> mode of a workload
to completion and then immediately (or after shutting down cleanly and
rebooting) running in <tt>check</tt> mode.
</p>

<p>
Use <tt>frack list</tt> to see the available workloads.
Some workloads take arguments; <em>size</em> arguments should be one
of the keywords <tt>small</tt>, <tt>medium</tt>, or <tt>large</tt>,
reflecting the size of the test file(s).
<em>Seed</em> arguments are integer random seeds from 0 to
2<sup>31</sup>-1.
</p>

<p>
Some workloads contain an explicit <tt>sync</tt>; generally these are
meant to be crashed after, not before (or during) the sync call.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>frack</tt> uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/fstat>fstat</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/ftruncate>ftruncate</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/getdirentry>getdirentry</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/read>read</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/link>link</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/remove>remove</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/chdir>chdir</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/mkdir>mkdir</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/rmdir>rmdir</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/rename>rename</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/sync>sync</A></li>
<li><A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A></li>
</ul>
but note that it is intended to be able to exercise all the
file-system-related calls and its exact requirements are
workload-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<tt>frack</tt> is most useful for testing file system recovery, by
intentionally crashing during workload runs.
But it is also useful for checking general correctness of a file
system.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
Currently, none of the specific workloads are documented.
