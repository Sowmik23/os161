<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
calloc - allocate and clear memory
</p>

<h3>Library</h3>
<p>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>void *</tt><br>
<tt>calloc(size_t </tt><em>number</em><tt>, size_t </tt><em>size</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>calloc</tt> allocates <em>number</em>*<em>size</em> bytes of
memory, zeros it, and returns a pointer to it. It is equivalent to
calling
<A HREF=malloc.html><tt>malloc</tt></A><tt>(</tt><em>number</em>*<em>size</em></tt>)</tt>
followed by <A HREF=bzero.html>bzero</A>.
</p>

<p>
If the product <em>number</em>*<em>size</em> overflows the range of
<tt>size_t</tt>, calloc fails.
</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>
<tt>calloc</tt> returns a pointer to the memory allocated. If memory
cannot be obtained, NULL is returned.
</p>
